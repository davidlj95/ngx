??? info "Standalone, module-free apps"

    This is the default approach for authoring Angular projects generated with Angular CLI v17 and above.
    It's also the recommended way to author Angular projects right now.
    Using standalone APIs is the preferred and recommended way to do so.
    You can use standalone APIs too despite the application is still module-based.
