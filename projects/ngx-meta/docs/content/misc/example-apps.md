# Example apps

In order to ensure library works as expected, we maintain some sample Angular apps. We then run some E2E tests to ensure everything works when used in a sample app. You can also use those apps as examples of how to use the library.

Sample apps live inside the [`e2e` directory of the project's repository](https://github.com/davidlj95/ngx/tree/main/projects/ngx-meta/e2e)
