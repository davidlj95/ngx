Welcome 🥰

Wondering why this library and not another one? Take a look at [why section](why/index.md). Probably most interesting parts are [**features**](features.md) and [**comparison**](comparison.md) pages.

For the hands-on devs ([_this is the way_](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-the-way)), [**get started now** ⚡️](get-started.md)

### Existing users

Take a look at guides to refresh your knowledge. Like the one about the [**metadata values JSON**](metadata-values-json.md).

Or maybe you just want to take a look at the [**API reference**](ngx-meta.md)?
