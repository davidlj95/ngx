??? info "Non-standalone, module-based apps"

    This is the default and traditional approach for authoring Angular projects generated with Angular CLI before v17.
    It's not the preferred or recommended way to author Angular projects right now.
    Using standalone APIs is the preferred and recommended way to do so.
    You can use standalone APIs too despite the application is still module-based.
    Learn more about standalone at [standalone components guide](https://v17.angular.io/guide/standalone-components)
    and [standalone migration](https://angular.dev/reference/migrations/standalone).
    You can anyway keep using the module-based equivalent APIs for now if you prefer to do so.
