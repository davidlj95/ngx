# Example apps

In order to ensure library works as expected, [there is some infrastructure to create example Angular apps][example-apps-infra] which use main library features. Then some [E2E tests][e2e-infra] run on them to ensure everything works when used in an example app. You can also use those apps' template files as examples of how to use the library.

Example app template files live inside the [example apps directory of the project's repository][example-apps-infra]
