Set your Angular site's metadata: standard meta tags, Open Graph,
Twitter Cards, JSON-LD structured data and more.
Supports SSR (and Angular Universal).
Use a service. Use routes' data.
Set it up in a flash! 🚀

> [!NOTE]
> Current version is a beta. APIs are now very stable and very open for feedback.
> Version 1.0.0 will be published after it has been in the wild for a while

## Motivation

You have a nice Angular-powered website. You want to improve its SEO and decide to add some metadata in your pages. You also enable [Server Side Rendering (SSR)][SSR] so when search engines visit your site, metadata elements are already in the HTML returned by the server. You start adding nice `<meta name="description">` to describe your home page. Then Open Graph metadata like `<meta property="og:title">` [to customize social cards / link previews](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-open-graph-and-how-can-i-use-it-for-my-website/). You use [Angular's `Meta` APIs][Angular Meta APIs] to insert those in your DOM. All good so far 😊

Now, you want to set metadata for another page of your site 🤔

Calls to [Angular `Meta` APIs][Angular Meta APIs] start appearing in many places around. Object literals specifying `<meta>` definitions breed like rabbits 🐇 You also have to ensure when changing pages that metadata from a page doesn't stay there when visiting another. It's all starting to be a bit tedious 😅

If only there was a way to easily specify metadata I want for each page in a declarative fashion and forget about it 🙏 You're in the right place then 🎉 This library will definitely help you 🥳

### New users

First, welcome 🥰

Wondering why this library and not another one? Take a look at [why section](https://ngx-meta.dev/why/). Probably most interesting parts are [**features**](https://ngx-meta.dev/why/features/) and [**comparison**](https://ngx-meta.dev/why/comparison/) pages.

For the hands-on devs ([_this is the way_](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-the-way)), [**get started now** ⚡️](https://ngx-meta.dev/get-started/)

### Existing users

Take a look at guides to refresh your knowledge. Like the one about setting metadata programmatically [**using the service**](https://ngx-meta.dev/guides/set-metadata-using-service/), in a declarative fashion [**using route's data**](https://ngx-meta.dev/guides/set-metadata-using-routing/). Or how [**metadata values JSON**](https://ngx-meta.dev/guides/metadata-values-json/) is shaped.

Go deeper by:

- [**Setting default metadata**](https://ngx-meta.dev/guides/defaults/) values for all pages
- [**Setting up URL resolution**](https://ngx-meta.dev/guides/url-resolution/) to use relative URLs but get absolute URLs as metadata values
- [**Loading metadata later**](https://ngx-meta.dev/guides/late-loading-modules/) to reduce main bundle size
- [**Providing your custom metadata managers**](https://ngx-meta.dev/guides/manage-your-custom-metadata/)
- [**Fine-grained choosing metadata elements**](https://ngx-meta.dev/guides/custom-metadata-providers-selection/) you're interested in. Rest of them won't end up in your bundle

Are you by any chance looking for the [**API reference**](https://ngx-meta.dev/api/ngx-meta/)?
