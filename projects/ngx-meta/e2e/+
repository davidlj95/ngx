# Issue or need

Example apps creation is very tightly coupled with E2E:
 - Lives in `e2e` dir
 - Runs in `e2e` CI/CD workflow

Therefore in CI/CD forces us to cache the PNPM store containing
 - Example app creation deps (Angular CLI / app deps / creation script deps)
 - E2E deps: Cypress

But they're pretty different things. We can split it to allow cache separation

<!-- Fixes # -->

# Proposed changes

Split example apps creation infra from E2E infra

This greatly simplifies E2E infra, and focuses all example app creation needs in:
 - One directory
 - One CI/CD workflow

<!-- Describe here HOW you're solving it -->
